Read at your own risk.\nThe Guy With The Stuff And Things\nBy Asher North\nYeah, so one time there was this guy named Greg, and he felt so excited. He felt this way because recently he had bought a book. It was called, \'The Stroy Of Those Two Guys\'. Greg wondered whether the typo \(stroy\) in the title was intentional or unintentional. Surely a typo like that wouldn\'t be able to get past the editors and proof readers. Maybe the \'stroy\' in the typo was intentional and it had a hidden meaning. Maybe it was short for \'destroy\'. Maybe the two guys mentioned in the title get destroyed, and the title meant, \'The Destroying Of Those Two Guys\'. Thoughts like this boggled Greg\'s mind. But then he realised that he had spent so much time contemplating the typo that he had never actually read the book! So he read the book, cover to cover. Once Greg finished the book, he wondered how long in total did he spend reading the book. To figure this out, he counted the amount of pages in the book. He counted three hundred and thirty two pages, but then he realised that he could have just looked at the page numbers to count them. After that he decided to count the amount of words per page. He stumbled across some interesting anomalies in the amount of words per page. For instance, page numbers ten, twenty and thirty had one hundred and twenty five words, but then pages forty, fifty and sixty had one hundred and twenty six! And then, to top it all off, pages seventy, eighty, and ninety had one hundred and twenty seven! Greg found this all very interesting, but then he accidentally dropped his book into the drain. The end.')
